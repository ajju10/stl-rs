This library aims to provide C++ STL like containers and algorithms without repeating the ones already present in rust 
standard library. It's in very early stages of development so please don't use it in for any serious thing yet though
you can always play around with this and maybe share some of your wisdom to help me improve it further ðŸ˜Š.
